        <h1>About Me</h1>

        <p>
            &#8620 I am a student at the University of Waterloo currently working towards my bachelor of Engineering in Systems
            Design Engineering.
            <br><br> &#8620 I love to play sports! I have played on many intramural teams at UW including Hockey, Soccer,
            Indoor Volleyball, Beach Volleyball, Flag Football and Ultimate Frisbee.
            <br><br> &#8620 I love new experiences and being able to learn new, relevant, and applicable skills.
            <br><br> &#8620 I love outdoor activities and think that there is no where better to be than on the water.
            <br><br> &#8620 I am a self-taught guitar player and mostly play any songs that I'm enjoying at the time.
            <br><br> &#8620 I love listening to music and am always trying to explore new genres, but my go to genres are
            rock, folk, and indie.

        <h3>Shottle</h3>
        <p>
            &#8620 A bottle that is meant to reduce alcohol consumption and increase water intake when drinking at social events.
            <br><br> &#8620 The bottle has two compartments, one for alcohol and one for water.
            <br><br> &#8620 The lid has to be held on the alcohol compartment or else a spring will force the opening to spin back
            to the water compartment.
            <br><br> &#8620 Our design team started off with defining our problem space, creating personas, and brainstorming ideas.
            <br><br> &#8620 Once we had our bottle idea, we followed an iterative design process by first creating a low-fidelity prototype then conducted user testing.
            <br><br> &#8620 Adjustments were made and this process was replicated for a medium-fidelity prototype.
            <br><br> &#8620 The high fidelity prototype was then designed in Solidworks by myself and another team member, and printed using a 3D printer.
            <br><br> &#8620 Final user testing was finally conducted.
        </p>

        <h3>Guitar Hero</h3>
        <p>
            &#8620 Recreation of Guitar Hero using two breadboards and an Arduino Uno.
            <br><br> &#8620 One breadboard/circuit has 4 sets of 4 different coloured LEDs. A signal is sent from
            the Arduino to the first set of LEDs, causing them to light up. That signal is then stored in a register.
            When the next signal comes in from the Arduino, the second set of LEDs illuminate with the first signal pattern
            and the first set of LEDs illuminates with the new signal pattern. This progression of signals continues
            until the game ends. The bottom set of LEDs is the set of lights that the player
            has to match.
            <br><br> &#8620 The other circuit has 4 buttons, each matching a correspondingly coloured LED. The player has
            to press the correct combination of buttons to match the fourth set of LEDs, or the ones closest to the player.
            <br><br> &#8620 The button combination is input into the Arduino, where an interrupt checks whether it corresponds
            to the signal. The combination of notes is audibly played if the input is correct, and an ugly noise is played
            if the input is incorrect.
            <br><br> &#8620 The streak of correct notes in a row is displayed in a console window, and the high score is
            kept track of and updated.
        </p>

        <h3>You Canâ€™t Hide</h3>
        <p>
            &#8620 A 3D Unity Horror Game inspired by Slenderman.
            <br><br> &#8620 I created the game flow, designed the atmosphere, wrote the story, and developed scripts in C#.
            <br><br> &#8620 The player must run around in the woods collecting red cubes and fighting off evil mushrooms.
            <br><br> &#8620 Every once and a while a larger monster will find the player and they must run for their life.
            <br><br> &#8620 Collect all 10 cubes and take them to the one friendly mushroom at the mountain to move on to the boss battle.
            <br><br> &#8620 In the boss battle, the player must collect shots by attacking the mushrooms and shoot them at the monster, which is now the size of a skyscraper.

        <h3>Hibernation</h3>
        <p>
            &#8620 A text-based adventure game created with PHP, HTML, CSS, and a MySQL database.
            <br><br>&#8620 I wrote the narrative, created a story board, designed the game flow, and wrote the code.
            <br><br>&#8620 Inspired by the classic adventure game Zork.
            <br><br>&#8620 The player wakes up in their bedroom on a moon base feeling disoriented. They must figure out
            what is going on by exploring the base, collecting items, and interacting with objects,
            all while staying safe.
