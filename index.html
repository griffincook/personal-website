        <h1>What is Systems Design Engineering?</h1>

        <p> &#8620Systems Design Engineering is one of the most broad Engineering programs at the University of Waterloo.
        <br><br> &#8620 It allows students to not only learn a lot of the math and sciences behind many Engineering jobs,
        but the program also focuses on how to design things with the user in mind.
        <br><br> &#8620 It's the only Engineering program in Canada that has a class that focuses on Human Factors in Engineering.
        <br><br> &#8620 There is a design course every school term, some of which are focused on one big group project.
        <br><br> &#8620 The class size is around 90 people, and we take almost all of our classes together, most in the same classroom. </p>
