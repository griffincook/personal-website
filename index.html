        <p> &#8620 I am a student at the University of Waterloo currently working towards my bachelor of Engineering in Systems
        Design Engineering.
        <br><br> &#8620 I worked as an application software developer for the world's trusted currency authority <a href="https://www.xe.com/" >XE.com</a>.
        <br><br> &#8620 I am currently working at one of the top companies in video streaming, <a href="https://www.ssimwave.com/">SSIMWAVE</a>.
        <br><br> &#8620 I love to play sports as well as cheer on the soon to be Stanley Cup Champions Toronto Maple Leafs (knock on wood).
        <br><br> &#8620 I love new experiences and being able to learn new, relevant, and applicable skills.

        <h1>What is Systems Design Engineering?</h1>

        <p> &#8620Systems Design Engineering is one of the most broad Engineering programs at the University of Waterloo.
        <br><br> &#8620 It allows students to not only learn a lot of the math and sciences behind many Engineering jobs,
        but the program also focuses on how to design things with the user in mind.
        <br><br> &#8620 It's the only Engineering program in Canada that has a class that focuses on Human Factors in Engineering.
        <br><br> &#8620 There is a design course every school term, some of which are focused on one big group project.
        <br><br> &#8620 The class size is around 90 people, and we take almost all of our classes together, most in the same classroom. </p>

        <h1>Why Systems Design Engineering?</h1>

        <p>I'd be lying if I said it was a clear decision for me. </p>
