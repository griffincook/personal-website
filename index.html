        <h1>Who Am I?</h1>

        <p>
            &#8620 I am a student at the University of Waterloo currently working towards my bachelor of Engineering in Systems
            Design Engineering.
            <br><br> &#8620 I love to play sports! I have played on many intramural teams at UW including Hockey, Soccer, Volleyball, and Ultimate Frisbee.
            <br><br> &#8620 I love new experiences and being able to learn new, relevant, and applicable skills.
            <br><br> &#8620 I love outdoor activities and think that there is no where better to be than on the water.
            <br><br> &#8620 I am a self-taught guitar player and mostly play any songs I'm enjoying at the time.
            <br><br> &#8620 I love listening to music and am always trying to explore new genres.

        <h1>Projects</h1>
        <h3>Shottle</h3>
        <p>
            &#8620 A bottle that is meant to reduce alcohol consumption and increase water intake when drinking at social events.
            <br><br> &#8620 The bottle has two compartments, one for alcohol and one for water.
            <br><br> &#8620 The lid has to be held on the alcohol compartment or else it will spin back to the water compartment.
            <br><br> &#8620 Our design team started off with defining our problem space, creating personas, and brainstorming ideas.
            <br><br> &#8620 Once we had our bottle idea, we followed through an iterative design process by first creating a low-fidelity prototype then conducted user testing.
            <br><br> &#8620 Adjustments were made and this process was replicated for a medium-fidelity prototype.
            <br><br> &#8620 The high fidelity prototype was then designed in Solidworks by myself and another team member, and printed using a 3D printer.
            <br><br> &#8620 Final user testing was finally conducted.
