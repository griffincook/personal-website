                        Indoor Volleyball, Beach Volleyball, Flag Football and Ultimate Frisbee.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Love outdoor activities and think that there is no where better to be than on the water.

                    <li>
                        A self-taught guitar player and mostly play any songs that I'm enjoying at the time.

                    <li>
                        Obsessed with listening to music and always trying to explore new genres, but my go to genres are

                        A bottle that is meant to reduce alcohol consumption and increase water intake when drinking at social events.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The bottle has two compartments, one for alcohol and one for water.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The lid has to be held on the alcohol compartment or else a spring will force the opening to spin back
                        to the water compartment.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Our design team started off with defining our problem space, creating personas, and brainstorming ideas.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Once we had our bottle idea, we followed an iterative design process by first creating a low-fidelity prototype then conducted user testing.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Adjustments were made and this process was replicated for a medium-fidelity prototype.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The high fidelity prototype was then designed in Solidworks by myself and another team member, and printed using a 3D printer.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Final user testing was finally conducted.

            <h3>Guitar Hero</h3>
            <div class="infoBlock">
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Recreation of Guitar Hero using two breadboards and an Arduino Uno.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        One breadboard/circuit has 4 sets of 4 different coloured LEDs.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A signal is sent from the Arduino to the first set of LEDs, causing them to light up. That signal is then stored in a register.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        When the next signal comes in from the Arduino, the second set of LEDs illuminate with the first signal pattern
                        and the first set of LEDs illuminates with the new signal pattern. This progression of signals continues until the game ends.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The bottom set of LEDs is the set of lights that the player has to match.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The other circuit has 4 buttons, each matching a correspondingly coloured LED. The player has
                        to press the correct combination of buttons to match the fourth set of LEDs, or the ones closest to the player.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The button combination is input into the Arduino, where an interrupt checks whether it corresponds
                        to the signal. The combination of notes is audibly played if the input is correct, and an ugly noise is played
                        if the input is incorrect.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The streak of correct notes in a row is displayed in a console window, and the high score is
                        kept track of and updated.
                    </li>
                </ul>
